Hello and welcome! After months of thinking about it, I finally built this personal website. As someone who spends their days ensuring government digital services work reliably for citizens, I wanted a space to share insights, document projects, and connect with others working at the intersection of technology and public service.

## Why Now?

Working in government QA has given me a unique perspective on how technology can serve (or sometimes fail) people when they need it most. Whether it's ensuring a benefits application doesn't break at 2 AM when someone desperately needs help, or making sure accessibility features actually work for citizens with disabilities, the stakes feel real in ways that private sector tech sometimes doesn't.

I've learned so much from this work that I want to share - both the technical lessons about building reliable systems and the broader insights about how technology intersects with policy and public service.

## What You'll Find Here

This site is organized into a few main sections:

**[Professional](/professional)** - My work experience, skills, and the projects I can talk about publicly. This is the page I can share with colleagues or potential collaborators without them getting confused by my travel photos.

**[Blog](/blog)** - Where I'll write about:
- Lessons learned in government QA and testing
- Thoughts on tech policy and digital service delivery
- Stories and insights from travels
- The intersection of art, technology, and human experience

**[Projects](/projects)** - A showcase of personal projects, data visualizations, photography, and creative work. Some will be technical demos, others will be more artistic explorations.

**[Contact](/contact)** - How to reach me if you want to discuss any of this stuff!

## The Balance Between Personal and Professional

One challenge I've thought about a lot is how to share authentically while maintaining professional credibility. Government work requires a certain level of discretion, but I also believe that sharing our experiences and insights makes the whole ecosystem stronger.

My approach is to focus on lessons learned and general insights rather than specific details about internal systems or processes. I want to contribute to conversations about making government tech better without compromising security or confidentiality.

## Looking Forward

I'm excited to start sharing more regularly. Some topics I'm planning to explore:

- **Testing in high-stakes environments** - What I've learned about QA when failure isn't an option
- **Accessibility as a mindset** - Moving beyond compliance to truly inclusive design
- **Tech policy implications** - How technical decisions become policy decisions
- **Travel and perspective** - How visiting different places shapes how I think about technology and governance
- **Creative projects** - Art and photography work that explores themes of systems, structures, and human experience

## Let's Connect

If you're working in government tech, civic technology, quality assurance, or anything adjacent, I'd love to hear from you. The challenges we face are often similar across different agencies and levels of government, and sharing approaches and solutions benefits everyone.

You can reach me at [your.email@example.com](mailto:your.email@example.com) or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/yourprofile).

Thanks for visiting, and I hope you find something useful or interesting here. Check back regularly - I'm planning to post new content weekly as I get into the rhythm of writing more publicly.
