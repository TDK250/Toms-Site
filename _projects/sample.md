## Project Overview

This dashboard was inspired by my experience implementing quality assurance processes at the Public Guardian and Trustee of BC. I noticed there was a need for better tracking and visualization of QA metrics across different teams and processes.

## Features

- **Process Tracking**: Monitor QA processes across different divisions
- **Error Analysis**: Identify patterns in service gaps and errors
- **Team Collaboration**: Track progress on quality improvements
- **Reporting Dashboard**: Visual insights for stakeholders

## Technical Implementation

The dashboard uses modern web technologies to create an intuitive interface for QA teams:

### Frontend
- **JavaScript** for interactive elements and data manipulation
- **Chart.js** for data visualizations
- **CSS Grid** for responsive layout

### Data Management
- CSV import functionality for existing QA data
- Local storage for session data
- Export capabilities for reports

## Lessons Learned

Building this project helped me understand how to translate real-world QA needs into technical solutions. Key insights:

- **User-Centered Design**: The interface needed to match how QA teams actually work
- **Data Visualization**: Charts needed to tell stories, not just display numbers  
- **Scalability**: Started simple but designed for future feature additions

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with government data systems (where appropriate)
- Automated report generation
- Team notification systems
- Mobile-responsive improvements

## Impact

This project demonstrates how technical skills can solve real government challenges, improving service quality for vulnerable populations served by organizations like the Public Guardian and Trustee.
