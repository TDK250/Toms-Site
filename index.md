  <h2>About My Work</h2>
  <p>I'm a University of Victoria Commerce and Entrepreneurship graduate working at the intersection of quality assurance, government services, and organizational leadership. My current role involves ensuring quality processes for vulnerable populations, while my background spans board governance, event management, consulting, and digital marketing.</p>
  
  <p>From serving as Vice President of a community centre board to managing student consultants, from coordinating major fundraising events to implementing QA processes in government - I've learned that effective leadership and quality processes are essential whether you're serving brain injury survivors, university students, or government clients.</p>
  
  <p>This site documents insights from these diverse experiences, projects that showcase different skills, and thoughts on how we can build better systems and processes that truly serve people.</p>
